  "The damage model of destroyers has been changed and now corresponds to a 'cruiser' form. The hull is divided into compartments responsible for flooding and housing the remaining modules. The crew is located in several internal compartments, from where it can be replenished into crew-carrying modules. "
  "Explosive armour Breach - Explosive armour Breach has been implemented for naval battles for all high-explosive projectiles with an instant fuse. When the shell detonates on an obstacle, the explosion penetration will be checked. And if it is sufficient for a breach, a gap in the obstacle will be breached into which gases and a sheaf of debris will rush. This allows optimization of the number of calculations for explosions on the armour and leads to a unified calculation of the force and damage of fragments and sectors of their dispersion. HE shells have become more effective in hitting modules and crew inside the ship if they have enough blast penetration."
  "On all large ships the damage model of open gunnery and units with open shields has been redesigned. They are now more susceptible to damage from close bursts and shrapnel."
  "Unnecessary holes appearing on naval vessels have been removed. Holes will only appear on the hull of the ship."
  "A bug with the probability of detonation of a vessel's own torpedoes has been fixed. The chance that the torpedo will detonate when it is destroyed is now 3-7% (depending on the conditions of destruction). There is also a small chance of detonation when a torpedo is exposed to a severe fire. If one torpedo detonates other torpedoes in the explosion zone may detonate under the same conditions. The probability will be checked for each torpedo individually. The force of the torpedo explosion depends on the type and quantity of explosives in its warhead and causes appropriate damage to the vessel in its radius. So a torpedo explosion in the launcher or in the cellar will not necessarily result in instant destruction of a ship, but it is possible. So is the chain detonation of all torpedoes affected by the explosion."
